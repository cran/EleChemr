\title{Derivative calculation of concentration profile}
\usage{
Derv(npoints = 2, h, Ox, mode = "Forward", Derivative = "First")
}
\arguments{
\item{npoints}{number of points to be used for the derivative}

\item{h}{space for the finite difference}

\item{Ox}{data upon the derivative is calculated}

\item{mode}{"Forward" or "Backward" the derivative will be calculated for the npoints}

\item{Derivative}{"First" or "Second" derivative to calculate}
}
\value{
a vector with the derivative requested
}
\description{
Return a the derivative of the concentration profile simulated
}
\examples{
Derv(npoints = 2, h = 0.13, Ox = matrix(c(1,2), nrow = 1), mode = "Forward", Derivative = "First")
